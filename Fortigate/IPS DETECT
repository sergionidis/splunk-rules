# Splunk Query for Firewall IPS Alert

This query is designed to detect potential security events from firewall logs, specifically filtering out IPS events and then analyzing the data for unusual behavior. It looks for multiple occurrences of the same event to potentially indicate a larger issue.

### Query:

```spl
index="*" sourcetype="yoursourcetype" subtype="ips" | rename "action" as "Action", "attack" as "Atttack", "level" as "Severity", "devname" as "Firewall", "dstip" as "Destination IP", "dstport" as "Destination Port", "msg" as "Info", "srcip" as "Source IP"
| table _time, "Action", "Severity", "Attack", "Firewall", "Info", "Source IP", "Destination IP", "Destination Port"
| stats count by "Source IP", "Info", "Ataque", "Action", "Puerto Destino"
| sort -count
| where count >= 10
